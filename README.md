## Explanation of Temperature Conversion

Fahrenheit and centigrade are two temperature scales in use today. The Fahrenheit scale was developed by the German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit . In the Fahrenheit scale, water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees.

*To understand temperature conversion, it's important to first understand the  main temperature scales and their reference points:

Celsius (°C):
The Celsius scale is widely used worldwide, especially in scientific contexts. It is based on the freezing point of water, which is defined as 0°C, and the boiling point of water, which is defined as 100°C under standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. The Celsius scale divides the temperature range between these two reference points into 100 equal intervals.

Fahrenheit (°F):
The Fahrenheit scale is primarily used in the United States and a few other countries. It also uses the freezing and boiling points of water as reference points, but with different values. The freezing point of water is defined as 32°F, and the boiling point of water is defined as 212°F under standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. The Fahrenheit scale divides the temperature range between these two reference points into 180 equal intervals.

For an exact conversion (Fahrenheit to Celsius / Celsius to Fahrenheit) the following formulas can be applied :

Fahrenheit to Celsius : (°F − 32) ÷ 1.8 = °C
Celsius to Fahrenheit : (°C × 1.8) + 32 = °F

An approximate conversion between degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit is as follows :

Fahrenheit to Celsius : Subtract 30 and halve the resulting number.
Celsius to Fahrenheit : Double the number and add 30.

Let's walk through an example conversion:
To convert 25°C to Fahrenheit:
°F = (25 × 9/5) + 32
°F = (45) + 32
°F = 77°F

Similarly, to convert 50°F to Celsius:
°C = (50 - 32) × 5/9
°C = (18) × 5/9
°C = 10°C
