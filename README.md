# Explanation

This README file provides an explanation of temperature conversion between Fahrenheit and Celsius scales. It includes information about the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales, their reference points, and the formulas for exact and approximate conversions.

The Fahrenheit scale was developed by the German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. It uses the freezing point of water as 32 degrees and the boiling point as 212 degrees. On the other hand, the Celsius scale is widely used worldwide and is based on the freezing point of water as 0 degrees and the boiling point as 100 degrees.

The README also provides the formulas for exact conversions between Fahrenheit and Celsius, as well as the approximate conversion formulas. It includes an example conversion to help understand the process.

Please note that this README file is specific to the "webdev-task-temp-convertor" project and is intended to provide background information and instructions for using the temperature conversion functionality within the project.

# Explanation
Fahrenheit and centigrade are two temperature scales in use today. The Fahrenheit scale was developed by the German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit . In the Fahrenheit scale, water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees.

*To understand temperature conversion, it's important to first understand the  main temperature scales and their reference points:

Celsius (°C):
The Celsius scale is widely used worldwide, especially in scientific contexts. It is based on the freezing point of water, which is defined as 0°C, and the boiling point of water, which is defined as 100°C under standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. The Celsius scale divides the temperature range between these two reference points into 100 equal intervals.

Fahrenheit (°F):
The Fahrenheit scale is primarily used in the United States and a few other countries. It also uses the freezing and boiling points of water as reference points, but with different values. The freezing point of water is defined as 32°F, and the boiling point of water is defined as 212°F under standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. The Fahrenheit scale divides the temperature range between these two reference points into 180 equal intervals.

For an exact conversion (Fahrenheit to Celsius / Celsius to Fahrenheit) the following formulas can be applied :

Fahrenheit to Celsius : (°F − 32) ÷ 1.8 = °C
Celsius to Fahrenheit : (°C × 1.8) + 32 = °F

An approximate conversion between degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit is as follows :

Fahrenheit to Celsius : Subtract 30 and halve the resulting number.
Celsius to Fahrenheit : Double the number and add 30.

Let's walk through an example conversion:
To convert 25°C to Fahrenheit:
°F = (25 × 9/5) + 32
°F = (45) + 32
°F = 77°F

Similarly, to convert 50°F to Celsius:
°C = (50 - 32) × 5/9
°C = (18) × 5/9
°C = 10°C
